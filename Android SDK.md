## The Android SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools and libraries that developers use to create applications for the Android operating system. 

### Components of the Android SDK

#### Tools:
Android Studio: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development. It includes a code editor, a layout editor, and tools for debugging and testing.
SDK Manager: A tool that helps manage different versions of the Android SDK, including updates, and allows you to install additional components.

#### Libraries:
The SDK includes a set of libraries that provide functionalities for various components of Android apps, such as user interface design, data storage, and network communication.

#### Emulator:
The Android Emulator allows developers to test applications on a virtual device that simulates various Android devices and configurations without needing physical hardware.
Debugging and Testing Tools:
Tools like Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and the Android Profiler help developers debug their applications and monitor performance.

#### APIs:
The SDK provides access to various Android APIs that allow developers to implement features such as camera access, location services, and notifications.

## **Importance of the Android SDK**

#### Development Framework:
The Android SDK provides a comprehensive framework for building Android applications, offering all the necessary tools to create, test, and debug apps.

#### Cross-Device Compatibility:
With the SDK, developers can create apps that work across a wide range of Android devices, including phones, tablets, and wearables.

#### Community and Support:
The Android SDK is backed by extensive documentation, tutorials, and a large developer community, making it easier to find resources and support.

#### Rapid Development:
The tools and libraries provided in the SDK facilitate rapid application development, allowing developers to implement complex features without starting from scratch.

#### Integration with Services:
The SDK allows for easy integration with various Google services (like Firebase, Google Maps, etc.), enhancing app functionality.

### EXAMPLE:

#### minSdk
Minimum Android API level your app can run on.

Normal set to minSdk = 21 / 24 / 26

#### targetSdk (More refers to behavior)
The APIs version the app has been tested against, The version of Android (APIs) that your app was created to run on.
**Note: Google play will have minimum request for targetSdk version**

#### compileSdk (More refers to actual technique APIs)
Define which level of APIs of the Android SDK the app been compiling with.
Can not be set lower than targetSdk version, while targetSdk can be set lower than compileSdk,

The version of the Android SDK that app is compiled against during the build process. It determines the set of APIs and features available for you to use in your code.
