## Activities
Represents a single screen in an app. It serves as the entry point for user interactions.
## Fragments
A modular section of an activity. Fragments can be reused across different activities and help manage complex UIs.
## Views
Basic UI elements such as:
TextView: Displays text to the user.
EditText: Allows user input.
Button: Triggers an action when clicked.
ImageView: Displays images.
## Layouts
Containers that define the arrangement of views within an Activity or Fragment. Common layout types include:
LinearLayout: Arranges child views in a single row or column.
RelativeLayout: Positions child views relative to each other.
ConstraintLayout: Provides flexible positioning and resizing of views.
ScrollView: Allows for scrolling content when the layout exceeds the screen size.
## RecyclerView
A flexible view for displaying a large dataset in a list format. It is more efficient than a ListView and supports complex layouts and item animations.
## ViewGroups
Special types of views that can contain other views (children). Examples include FrameLayout, LinearLayout, and RelativeLayout.
## Dialogs
Temporary UI components that provide alerts, prompts, or options. Common types include:
AlertDialog: For simple messages or prompts.
ProgressDialog: To indicate loading or processing.
## Menus
UI elements that provide options and actions to the user, often appearing in the app bar or as context menus.
## Navigation Components
A set of libraries and components that help manage app navigation, including:
NavHostFragment: Hosts the navigation graph.
NavController: Manages app navigation within the NavHost.
## Material Components
A library that implements Material Design components, providing modern UI elements like:
BottomNavigationView
FloatingActionButton
Snackbars
## Data Binding
A feature that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format.
## ViewModels and LiveData
Part of the Architecture Components, these help manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
